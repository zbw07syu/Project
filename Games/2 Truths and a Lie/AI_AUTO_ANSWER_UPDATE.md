# AI Auto-Answer Implementation

## Overview
Updated the "2 Truths and a Lie" game so that AI teams now use true/false facts about various topics, and the game automatically knows which sentence is false when an AI team submits, eliminating the need for teacher to manually select the answer.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated AI Fact Pool
**File:** `game.js` (lines 47-77)

Replaced personal statements with educational true/false facts covering:
- **Geography - Capitals** (3 sets)
  - Example: "The capital of Australia is Sydney" (FALSE - it's Canberra)
- **Science - Solar System** (3 sets)
  - Example: "Venus is the largest planet in our solar system" (FALSE - it's Jupiter)
- **Animals** (3 sets)
  - Example: "Sharks are mammals" (FALSE - they're fish)
- **History** (2 sets)
  - Example: "The first moon landing was in 1959" (FALSE - it was 1969)
- **Mathematics** (2 sets)
  - Example: "A square has five corners" (FALSE - it has four)
- **Human Body** (2 sets)
  - Example: "Humans have four lungs" (FALSE - we have two)
- **General Knowledge** (1 set)
  - Example: "A year has 400 days" (FALSE - it has 365)

### 2. Added AI Answer Tracking
**File:** `game.js` (line 45)

Added new state variable:
```javascript
let aiCorrectAnswer = null; // Tracks which sentence (A, B, or C) is false when AI submits
```

### 3. Modified `aiSubmitSentences()` Function
**File:** `game.js` (lines 439-464)

Updated to track which position (A, B, or C) contains the lie:
- Wraps sentences in objects with `text` and `isLie` properties
- After shuffling, determines which position has the lie
- Stores the correct answer in `aiCorrectAnswer` variable

### 4. Modified `onSubmitGuesses()` Function
**File:** `game.js` (lines 293-317)

Added automatic answer revelation:
- Checks if `aiCorrectAnswer` is set (meaning AI team submitted)
- If yes: automatically calls `revealAnswer()` with the correct answer
- If no: shows the answer modal for teacher to select (human team submitted)
- Resets `aiCorrectAnswer` after use

### 5. Reset Logic
Added `aiCorrectAnswer = null` to:
- `startTeacherRound()` (line 174) - Reset at start of teacher round
- `startTeamRound()` (line 402) - Reset at start of each team round
- `restartGame()` (line 662) - Reset when game restarts

## Game Flow with AI Teams

### When AI Team Submits Sentences:
1. AI team's turn begins
2. Game selects random fact set from pool
3. Sentences are shuffled into positions A, B, C
4. Game tracks which position has the lie
5. Sentences displayed to players
6. Human teams and teacher make guesses
7. Teacher clicks "Submit Guesses"
8. **Game automatically reveals the correct answer** (no modal shown)
9. Points awarded to correct guessers
10. Next round begins

### When Human Team Submits Sentences:
1. Human team tells teacher their sentences
2. Teacher writes sentences in boxes A, B, C
3. Teacher clicks "Submit"
4. AI teams and other human teams make guesses
5. Teacher clicks "Submit Guesses"
6. **Modal appears asking teacher to select false sentence**
7. Teacher selects A, B, or C
8. Points awarded to correct guessers
9. Next round begins

## Benefits

1. **Faster Gameplay**: No need for teacher to manually select answer when AI submits
2. **Educational Content**: Students learn real facts about various topics
3. **Accurate Scoring**: Eliminates possibility of teacher selecting wrong answer for AI facts
4. **Seamless Experience**: Automatic answer revelation happens instantly after guesses submitted
5. **Maintains Flexibility**: Teacher still controls answer selection for human team submissions

## Testing Checklist

- [x] AI teams use new factual statements
- [x] Sentences are properly shuffled
- [x] Game tracks correct answer when AI submits
- [x] Answer automatically revealed after guesses submitted (AI rounds)

## Future Enhancements (Potential)

- Add more fact sets (expand to 30-50 facts)
