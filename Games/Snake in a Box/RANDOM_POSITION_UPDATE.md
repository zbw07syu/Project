# Snake in a Box - Random Position Update

## Summary
Updated the snake generation algorithm to ensure that the snake's head and tail appear in random positions on the grid while avoiding corner tiles, making the game more challenging and varied.

## Changes Made

### Modified File: `game.js`

#### 1. Enhanced Head/Tail Position Selection (Lines 233-296)
**Previous Behavior:**
- The algorithm would find "valid split points" where head and tail weren't adjacent
- However, it didn't explicitly avoid corners, leading to head/tail frequently appearing in corner positions
- This made the game too easy as players would check corners first

**New Behavior:**
- Added explicit corner detection and avoidance **for HEAD and TAIL only**
- **Important:** Body segments CAN and MUST appear in corners (they become corner/bend pieces)
- Valid head positions now ensure:
  1. The head position is not in a corner
  2. The tail position (opposite end of path) is also not in a corner
- Implemented a fallback hierarchy:
  - **Primary:** Use positions where both head and tail avoid corners
  - **Secondary:** If no ideal positions exist, at least keep the head out of corners
  - **Tertiary:** As a last resort, use completely random positions (should never happen)

#### 2. Added Verification Logging (Lines 314-325)
- Added console logging to verify head and tail positions
- Warns if head or tail ends up in a corner (shouldn't happen with new logic)
- Confirms success when both are outside corners

## Technical Details

### Corner Definition
Corners are defined as the four grid positions:
- Top-left: (0, 0)
- Top-right: (0, gridSize-1)
- Bottom-left: (gridSize-1, 0)
- Bottom-right: (gridSize-1, gridSize-1)

### Algorithm Flow
1. Generate a Hamiltonian path (visits all tiles exactly once, including corners)
2. Identify all valid head positions where:
   - The head position is not in a corner
   - The tail position (opposite end after reordering) is also not in a corner
3. Randomly select from valid head positions
4. Reorder the path so the selected position becomes the head (index 0)
5. The opposite end of the path becomes the tail (last index)

### Why This Works
- The Hamiltonian path ensures all tiles are connected in one continuous snake
- **Corner tiles will always have body segments** (specifically corner/bend pieces due to geometry)
- By selecting head positions that keep both head and tail out of corners, we guarantee:
  - Head and tail won't be in predictable corner locations
  - The snake remains fully connected with proper body segments everywhere
  - Corner tiles will have the correct corner/bend body pieces
  - Each game will have different head/tail positions

## Testing

### Test File: `test_random_positions.html`
Created a visual testing tool that:
- Generates multiple snakes to verify randomness
- Highlights head (red), tail (blue), body (green), and corners (orange)
- Shows statistics on corner placement
- Confirms that head and tail avoid corners

### How to Test
1. Open `test_random_positions.html` in a browser
2. Click buttons to generate multiple snakes with different grid sizes
3. Verify that:
   - Head (H) and Tail (T) are never in corner tiles (marked with ◢)
   - Positions vary across different generations
   - Statistics show 0% corner placement for head and tail

### Manual Testing in Game
1. Open `index.html` in a browser
2. Start a new game
3. Open browser console (F12)
4. Look for the log message: "✓ Success: Neither head nor tail is in a corner"
5. Play multiple games and verify head/tail appear in different positions

## Expected Results

### Before Changes
- Head and tail frequently appeared in corners
- Players could easily find them by checking corners first
- Less variety in gameplay

### After Changes
- Head and tail appear in random non-corner positions
- Increased difficulty and unpredictability
- More engaging gameplay with varied snake configurations
- Console confirms proper placement with success messages

## Compatibility
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- All sprite rendering logic remains unchanged
- Game rules and scoring system unaffected
- Works with all grid sizes (5x5, 6x6, 7x7)

## Performance
- No significant performance impact
- Algorithm still completes in milliseconds
- Fallback mechanisms ensure reliable generation even in edge cases
