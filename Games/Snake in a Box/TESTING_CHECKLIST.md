# ✅ Testing Checklist - Corner Piece Fix

## Quick Test (2 minutes)

### Test 1: Play the Game
1. ☐ Open `index.html` in your browser
2. ☐ Start a new game (any grid size: 5x5, 6x6, or 7x7)
3. ☐ Open browser console (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
4. ☐ Look for these messages:
   ```
   ✓ Corner (0,0) has valid corner piece: bottom-right
   ✓ Corner (0,4) has valid corner piece: bottom-left
   ✓ Corner (4,0) has valid corner piece: right-top
   ✓ Corner (4,4) has valid corner piece: left-top
   ✓ Generated valid random Hamiltonian path on attempt X
   ```
5. ☐ Click on the **top-left corner** tile
6. ☐ Verify it shows a **corner/bend piece** (◢ ◣ ◤ or ◥)
7. ☐ Click on the **bottom-left corner** tile (the one you reported)
8. ☐ Verify it shows a **corner/bend piece** (NOT ━ horizontal)
9. ☐ Click on the **top-right corner** tile
10. ☐ Verify it shows a **corner/bend piece**
11. ☐ Click on the **bottom-right corner** tile
12. ☐ Verify it shows a **corner/bend piece**

**Expected Result:** All 4 corners show corner/bend pieces, never straight pieces.

## Thorough Test (5 minutes)

### Test 2: Use the Test Tool
1. ☐ Open `test_corner_validation.html` in your browser
2. ☐ Click "Generate 10 Snakes" button
3. ☐ Look at the generated grids
4. ☐ Verify all **yellow-highlighted corners** show: ◢ ◣ ◤ ◥
5. ☐ Verify **NO corners** show: ━ (horizontal) or ┃ (vertical)
6. ☐ Check the statistics panel:
   - ☐ "Invalid Corner Pieces" should be **0**
   - ☐ "Head in Corner" should be **0**
   - ☐ "Tail in Corner" should be **0**
   - ☐ "Success Rate" should be **100%**

**Expected Result:** All statistics show 0 errors, 100% success rate.

## Stress Test (10 minutes)

### Test 3: Multiple Games
1. ☐ Open `index.html`
2. ☐ Play 5 games with **5x5 grid** (2 players)
   - ☐ Check all 4 corners in each game
   - ☐ Verify no straight pieces in corners
3. ☐ Play 5 games with **6x6 grid** (3 players)
   - ☐ Check all 4 corners in each game
   - ☐ Verify no straight pieces in corners
4. ☐ Play 5 games with **7x7 grid** (4 players)
   - ☐ Check all 4 corners in each game
   - ☐ Verify no straight pieces in corners

**Expected Result:** In all 15 games, all corners have corner/bend pieces.

---

## Console Verification

### Test 4: Check Console Logs
1. ☐ Open `index.html` with console open (F12)
2. ☐ Start a new game
3. ☐ Look for validation messages:
   ```
   ✓ Corner (0,0) has valid corner piece: bottom-right
   ✓ Corner (0,4) has valid corner piece: bottom-left
   ✓ Corner (4,0) has valid corner piece: right-top
   ✓ Corner (4,4) has valid corner piece: left-top
   ```
4. ☐ Verify **NO error messages** like:
   ```
   ❌ Corner (x,y) has STRAIGHT piece: left-right - INVALID!
   ```
5. ☐ Check generation success message:
   ```
   ✓ Generated valid random Hamiltonian path on attempt X
   ```
6. ☐ Verify attempt number is usually **1-5** (efficient)

**Expected Result:** All validation passes, no error messages.

## Edge Cases

### Test 5: Rapid Regeneration
1. ☐ Open `index.html`
2. ☐ Click "New Game" button 10 times rapidly
3. ☐ Check console for any errors
4. ☐ Verify each game generates successfully
5. ☐ Verify no "WARNING: Even zigzag path has invalid corner pieces!"

**Expected Result:** All games generate successfully without warnings.

---

## Visual Inspection

### Test 6: Corner Piece Types
For each corner position, verify the correct piece appears:

#### Top-Left Corner (0,0)
- ☐ Should show: **◢** (connects bottom + right)
- ☐ Should NOT show: ━ ┃ or other corners

#### Top-Right Corner (0,n)
- ☐ Should show: **◣** (connects bottom + left)
- ☐ Should NOT show: ━ ┃ or other corners

#### Bottom-Left Corner (n,0)
- ☐ Should show: **◥** (connects top + right)
- ☐ Should NOT show: ━ ┃ or other corners

#### Bottom-Right Corner (n,n)
- ☐ Should show: **◤** (connects top + left)
- ☐ Should NOT show: ━ ┃ or other corners

**Note:** The specific corner piece (◢ ◣ ◤ ◥) depends on the path direction, but it must be ONE of these four, never a straight piece.

## Regression Testing

### Test 7: Previous Features Still Work
1. ☐ Head never appears in corners (previous fix)
2. ☐ Tail never appears in corners (previous fix)
3. ☐ All tiles are filled (no empty spaces)
4. ☐ Snake is fully connected (no gaps)
5. ☐ Game is playable and fun
6. ☐ Clicking tiles reveals correct pieces
7. ☐ Winning condition works (find head and tail)
8. ☐ Multiple players can play

**Expected Result:** All previous features work correctly.

---

## Performance Check

### Test 8: Generation Speed
1. ☐ Open console and note generation time
2. ☐ Most games should generate in **1-5 attempts**
3. ☐ Maximum attempts is **50** (fallback to zigzag)
4. ☐ Each attempt takes ~200ms max
5. ☐ Total generation time should be **< 2 seconds**

**Expected Result:** Fast generation, no noticeable delay.

---

## Final Verification

### Test 9: The Original Bug
Reproduce the exact scenario you reported:

1. ☐ Open `index.html`
2. ☐ Start a new game
3. ☐ Click on the **bottom-left corner** (the tile you originally clicked)
4. ☐ Verify it shows a **corner/bend piece** (◥ or similar)
5. ☐ Verify it does NOT show **━** (horizontal piece)
6. ☐ Verify the piece is properly connected on both sides

**Expected Result:** Bottom-left corner shows a corner piece, NOT a horizontal piece.

## Summary Checklist

- ☐ All corners have corner/bend pieces (◢ ◣ ◤ ◥)
- ☐ No corners have straight pieces (━ ┃)
- ☐ Head never in corners
- ☐ Tail never in corners
- ☐ All pieces properly connected
- ☐ Console shows validation success
- ☐ Test tool shows 0 invalid corners
- ☐ Game generates quickly (1-5 attempts)
- ☐ All grid sizes work (5x5, 6x6, 7x7)
- ☐ Original bug is fixed

## If You Find Issues

### If a corner has a straight piece:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Note which corner and which piece appeared
3. Take a screenshot
4. Report the issue with console logs

### If generation is slow:
1. Check console for attempt count
2. If > 10 attempts regularly, may need optimization
3. Check if zigzag fallback is being used

### If validation fails:
1. Console will show: `❌ Corner (x,y) has STRAIGHT piece`
2. This means the validation is working (catching bad paths)
3. Should regenerate automatically

---

## Success Criteria

✅ **Fix is successful if:**
- All corners always have corner/bend pieces
- No corners ever have straight pieces
- Console shows validation success
- Test tool shows 0 invalid corners
- Original bug cannot be reproduced
