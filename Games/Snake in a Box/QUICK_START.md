## üîß Integration with Wingit!

### Adding Questions
Questions are passed via URL hash parameter:

```javascript
// Format
#questions={"id":"123","name":"Quiz","listType":"regular","questions":[...]}

// Example
const questions = {
  id: "quiz-001",
  name: "General Knowledge",
  listType: "regular",
  questions: [
    {
      type: "multiple-choice",
      text: "What is 2+2?",
      options: ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
      answer: "4"
    }
  ]
};

// Launch game with questions
const url = `index.html#questions=${encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(questions))}`;
window.open(url);
```

### Without Questions
Simply open `index.html` directly - the game will skip the question phase.

## üé® Customization

### Change Team Colors
Edit `game.js` line 43-44:
```javascript
const teamColors = ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow'];
const teamNames = ['Red Team', 'Blue Team', 'Green Team', 'Yellow Team'];
```

### Change Grid Sizes
Edit `game.js` line 102:
```javascript
gridSize = numTeams === 2 ? 5 : numTeams === 3 ? 6 : 7;
// Change to: gridSize = numTeams === 2 ? 6 : numTeams === 3 ? 7 : 8;
```

### Change Snake Length
Edit `game.js` line 126:
```javascript
const snakeLength = Math.floor(totalTiles * 0.6); // 60% of grid
// Change to: const snakeLength = Math.floor(totalTiles * 0.5); // 50% of grid
```

### Change Background Music
Replace `alwaysloveyou.mp3` with your own file (keep same name) or edit `index.html` line 46:
```html
<audio id="bgMusic" src="your-music.mp3" loop></audio>
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Music Won't Play
**Problem**: Browser blocks autoplay  
**Solution**: Click anywhere on the page first, then music will start

### Questions Not Showing
**Problem**: URL hash not formatted correctly  
**Solution**: Use `test.html` to generate proper URL format

### Tiles Not Revealing
**Problem**: JavaScript error or file path issue  
**Solution**: Check browser console (F12) for errors

### Images Not Loading
**Problem**: Incorrect file paths  
**Solution**: Verify `assets/images/snake/` folder contains all 6 PNG files

### Shared Scripts Not Found
**Problem**: `shared-modal.js` or `victoryManager.js` missing  
**Solution**: Ensure these files exist in parent `Games/` folder
