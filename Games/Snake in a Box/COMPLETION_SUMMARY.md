## 🔗 Integration Points

### Shared Modal System
```javascript
window.showOptionsModal(
  question,      // Question text
  options,       // Array of answer options
  callback,      // Function to call with selected answer
  imagePath,     // Optional image path
  turnIndicator  // "Team Name must answer"
);
```

### Victory Manager System
```javascript
window.victoryManager.playVictory(
  winnerName,    // "Red Team"
  winnerColor    // "red"
);
```

### Question Format
```javascript
{
  id: "quiz-id",
  name: "Quiz Name",
  listType: "regular",
  questions: [
    {
      type: "multiple-choice",
      text: "Question text?",
      options: ["A", "B", "C", "D"],
      answer: "B",
      image: "optional/path.jpg"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🐛 Known Considerations

### 1. Snake Path Generation
- Uses random walk algorithm
- May create unusual snake shapes
- Always ensures valid path
- Head and tail always accessible

### 2. Question Handling
- Gracefully handles missing questions
- Resets question pool when exhausted
- Skips question phase if no questions loaded

### 3. Audio Autoplay
- Modern browsers may block autoplay
- User interaction required to start music
- Fallback error handling in place

### 4. Browser Compatibility
- Tested for modern browsers
- Uses standard CSS and JavaScript
- No experimental features
