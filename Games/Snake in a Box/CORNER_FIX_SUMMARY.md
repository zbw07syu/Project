# Corner Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
After the initial implementation, a critical issue was discovered: corner tiles were appearing without snake segments, showing disconnected body pieces. This violated the fundamental rule that in a Hamiltonian path (which visits every tile), **corner tiles MUST contain snake segments**.

## Root Cause
The initial fix attempted to avoid placing ANY snake segments in corners, but this was incorrect because:
1. A Hamiltonian path visits ALL tiles exactly once
2. Corner tiles can only connect to two adjacent sides (not opposite sides)
3. Therefore, corner tiles MUST have corner/bend body pieces

## Correct Solution
**Only the HEAD and TAIL should avoid corners, not body segments.**

### Why This Makes Sense
- **Gameplay:** Players look for the special head and tail pieces, so keeping them out of corners increases difficulty
- **Geometry:** Corner tiles will naturally have corner/bend body pieces due to the path geometry
- **Completeness:** All tiles are filled, maintaining a continuous snake

## Implementation Details

### What Was Changed
Modified the selection logic to:
1. Generate a complete Hamiltonian path (includes all tiles, including corners)
2. Find positions where placing the head would result in:
   - Head NOT in a corner
   - Tail (opposite end) NOT in a corner
   - Body segments CAN be anywhere (including corners)
3. Randomly select from these valid positions

### Code Logic
```javascript
// Check each potential head position
for (let i = 0; i < snakePath.length; i++) {
  const headTile = snakePath[i];
  const tailIndex = (i - 1 + snakePath.length) % snakePath.length;
  const tailTile = snakePath[tailIndex];
  
  // Valid if NEITHER head NOR tail is in a corner
  // (body segments can be anywhere)
  if (!isCorner(headTile) && !isCorner(tailTile)) {
    validHeadIndices.push(i);
  }
}
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Hamiltonian Path = All Tiles:** Every tile must be part of the snake
2. **Corner Geometry:** Corners can only have bend/corner pieces (not straight pieces)
3. **Head/Tail Placement:** Only these special pieces should avoid corners
4. **Body Segments:** Can and must appear everywhere, including corners

## Testing Verification

When testing, you should see:
- ✅ All four corners have snake body segments (corner/bend pieces)
- ✅ Head (H) is never in a corner
- ✅ Tail (T) is never in a corner
- ✅ Snake is fully connected with no gaps
- ✅ Different head/tail positions each game
