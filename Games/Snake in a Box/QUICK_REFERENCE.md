# Quick Reference - Snake Rendering System

## 🎯 What Changed
- Snake now fills **100% of tiles** (was 60%)
- Uses **14 custom PNG sprites** (was 5 generic ones)
- Snake is **visually continuous** with proper head, body, and tail

## 🚀 Quick Test
1. Open `index.html` in browser
2. Open console (F12)
3. Start game
4. Look for: `Snake generated with X segments (target: X)` ← Should match!
5. Reveal tiles - should see connected snake parts

## 📊 Console Output
```
✅ Good:
Snake generated with 25 segments (target: 25)
Sprite distribution: { head-right: 1, tail-down: 1, body-horizontal: 10, ... }

❌ Bad:
Warning: Snake only covers 23/25 tiles (92.0%)
3 empty tiles remaining! Snake generation incomplete.
```

## 🎨 Sprite Types
| Type | Count | Examples |
|------|-------|----------|
| Head | 1 | head-up, head-down, head-left, head-right |
| Tail | 1 | tail-up, tail-down, tail-left, tail-right |
| Body | Many | body-horizontal, body-vertical |
| Corners | Many | corner-1, corner-2, corner-3, corner-4 |

## 🔧 Common Fixes

### Problem: Snake doesn't fill grid
```javascript
// In game.js, line ~128:
const maxAttempts = 50000; // Increase this
```

### Problem: Corners look wrong
```javascript
// In game.js, getCornerSprite() function:
// Swap the corner numbers around until they look right
'up-right': 'corner-3',  // Try different corner numbers
```

### Problem: Sprites don't load
Check these filenames in CSS match actual files:
- `Snake head facing up.png.png` ← Double .png!
- `Snake head facing right.png.png` ← Double .png!
- `Body section hoizontal.png` ← Typo: "hoizontal"!

## 📁 Files Changed
- ✏️ `game.js` - Snake generation logic
- ✏️ `style.css` - Sprite CSS classes
- 📄 `test_snake.html` - Testing utility (new)
- 📄 Documentation files (new)

## 🎮 Gameplay
- **Unchanged**: Game rules, scoring, win condition
- **Changed**: Visual appearance only
- **Better**: Snake looks like a real continuous creature

## 🐛 Debug Commands
```javascript
// In browser console while game is running:
console.log(snakePath);        // See the path
console.log(grid);             // See the grid data
console.log(snakePath.length); // Check coverage
```

## ✅ Success Criteria
- [x] Console shows 100% coverage
- [x] Exactly 1 head sprite
- [x] Exactly 1 tail sprite
- [x] All tiles reveal snake parts
- [x] Snake looks connected
- [x] Game plays to completion
