## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Snake Generation Algorithm
- Random walk algorithm starting from random position
- Snake length = ~60% of grid tiles
- Proper segment typing based on direction changes
- Ensures valid path through grid

### Turn Order System
- Dice rolls recalculated each round
- Sorted by roll value (highest first)
- Scoreboard updates to reflect order
- Current team visually highlighted

### Question Integration
- Uses `window.showOptionsModal()` from shared-modal.js
- Correct function signature: `(question, options, callback, imagePath, turnIndicator)`
- Turn indicator shows which team must answer
- Callback handles answer validation

### Victory Integration
- Uses `window.victoryManager.playVictory()` from victoryManager.js
- Passes winner name and color
- Triggers confetti, strobe, and victory music
- Consistent with other games

## ðŸŽ® Game Flow

   - Show team selection modal
   - Initialize teams and grid size

2. **Game Start**

   - Create grid with coordinate labels
   - Start background music
   - Begin first turn

3. **Turn Cycle**
   - Show "Roll Dice" button
   - All teams roll dice
   - Display rolls and turn order
   - Lowest roll team answers question
