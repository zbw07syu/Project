# Path Validation Fix

## Issue Identified

You reported seeing adjacent tiles (C6 and D6) with incompatible sprites:
- **C6**: Vertical piece (┃) - connects top and bottom
- **D6**: Horizontal piece (━) - connects left and right

Since C6 and D6 are horizontally adjacent (same row, adjacent columns), if D6 has a horizontal piece connecting left-right, it should connect to C6. But C6's vertical piece means it connects top-bottom, NOT to D6.

**This indicates a path connectivity bug** - the snake path may have non-adjacent tiles in sequence.

## Root Cause

The original code validated:
1. ✅ Corner pieces (no straight pieces in corners)
2. ❌ **Missing**: Path connectivity (consecutive tiles must be adjacent)

The Hamiltonian path generation algorithm (DFS) should only create paths where consecutive tiles are adjacent, but there was no validation to catch bugs if this failed.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added `validatePathConnectivity()` Function

**Location**: `game.js` lines 207-235

This function validates:
- **Adjacency**: Every consecutive pair of tiles in the path must be exactly 1 step apart (Manhattan distance = 1)
- **Uniqueness**: No tile appears twice in the path
- **Error reporting**: Logs specific coordinates where connectivity fails

```javascript
function validatePathConnectivity(path) {
  // Check consecutive tiles are adjacent
  for (let i = 1; i < path.length; i++) {
    const prev = path[i - 1];
    const curr = path[i];
    
    const rowDiff = Math.abs(curr.row - prev.row);
    const colDiff = Math.abs(curr.col - prev.col);
    
    if (rowDiff + colDiff !== 1) {
      console.error(`❌ Path connectivity error at index ${i}: 
        (${prev.row},${prev.col}) → (${curr.row},${curr.col}) are not adjacent!`);
      return false;
    }
  }
  
  // Check for duplicates
  const visited = new Set();
  for (let i = 0; i < path.length; i++) {
    const key = `${path[i].row},${path[i].col}`;
    if (visited.has(key)) {
      console.error(`❌ Duplicate tile in path at index ${i}: (${path[i].row},${path[i].col})`);
      return false;
    }
    visited.add(key);
  }
  
  return true;
}
```

### 2. Updated `generateSnake()` to Validate Connectivity

**Location**: `game.js` lines 309-340

Now validates BOTH connectivity and corner pieces:

```javascript
while (attempts < maxAttempts) {
  attempts++;
  const candidatePath = generateRandomHamiltonianPath(timeoutPerAttempt);
  
  if (candidatePath.length === totalTiles) {
    // Validate path connectivity first
    if (!validatePathConnectivity(candidatePath)) {
      console.error(`Attempt ${attempts}: Path has connectivity errors, retrying...`);
      continue;
    }
    
    // Check if corners have valid pieces
    if (validateCornerPieces(candidatePath)) {
      snakePath = candidatePath;
      console.log(`✓ Generated valid random Hamiltonian path on attempt ${attempts}`);
      break;
    }
  }
}

// Fallback validation
if (snakePath.length !== totalTiles) {
  snakePath = generateZigzagPath();
  
  if (!validatePathConnectivity(snakePath)) {
    console.error('⚠️ CRITICAL: Zigzag path has connectivity errors!');
  }
  
  if (!validateCornerPieces(snakePath)) {
    console.error('⚠️ WARNING: Zigzag path has invalid corner pieces!');
  }
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Path Debugger Tool

**File**: `path_debugger.html`

Added comprehensive connectivity checking:
- Shows path order numbers in each cell
- Validates adjacency between consecutive tiles
- Reports specific coordinates where errors occur
- Visual grid with color-coded corners, head, and tail

## Testing Instructions

### Test the Game

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Open browser console (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
3. Start a new game (select number of teams)
4. Look for console messages:
   - ✅ `✓ Generated valid random Hamiltonian path on attempt X`
   - ✅ `✓ All sprite connections are valid`
   - ❌ `❌ Path connectivity error...` (should NOT appear)

### Test with Debugger

1. Open `path_debugger.html` in your browser
2. Click "Generate New Snake" multiple times
3. Check the diagnostic report for:
   - **Path Connectivity**: Should show "✓ All consecutive tiles are adjacent"
   - **Corner Pieces**: All corners should have valid bend pieces
   - **Sprite Assignments**: Should match connections

## What This Fixes

### Before
- ❌ Could generate paths with non-adjacent consecutive tiles
- ❌ Adjacent grid tiles could have incompatible sprites
- ❌ No validation to catch connectivity bugs

### After
- ✅ All consecutive tiles in path are guaranteed adjacent
- ✅ Sprite assignments always match actual connections
- ✅ Comprehensive validation catches any bugs
- ✅ Detailed error logging for debugging

## Expected Behavior

After this fix:

1. **Path Generation**: Only accepts paths where every consecutive pair of tiles is adjacent
2. **Corner Validation**: Corners only have bend pieces (◢ ◣ ◤ ◥), never straight pieces (━ ┃)
3. **Sprite Assignment**: Sprites always match the actual path connections
4. **Visual Display**: What you see matches the underlying path structure

## If You Still See Issues

If you see adjacent tiles with incompatible sprites after this fix:

1. Open browser console
2. Look for error messages starting with `❌`
3. Take a screenshot of:
   - The grid with the problematic tiles
   - The console output
4. Share the specific coordinates and error messages

The new validation should catch and reject any invalid paths during generation, so this issue should no longer occur.

## Technical Notes

### Why This Bug Could Occur

The DFS algorithm in `generateRandomHamiltonianPath()` should only create valid paths, but:
- Race conditions or timing issues could cause incomplete paths
- Array manipulation bugs could create gaps
- The algorithm could theoretically have edge cases

### Defense in Depth

The fix uses multiple validation layers:
1. **Generation**: DFS only moves to adjacent tiles
2. **Validation**: `validatePathConnectivity()` verifies adjacency
3. **Verification**: Console logging shows connection details
4. **Debugging**: Path debugger tool visualizes the structure

This ensures that even if one layer fails, others will catch the issue.
