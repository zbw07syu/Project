## Troubleshooting

### Game Won't Launch
- **Check**: Is your list a vocab list? Memory Madness only works with vocab lists
- **Solution**: Create or select a vocab list, not a regular question list

### No Images Showing
- **Check**: Do your vocab items have image URLs?
- **Solution**: Add image URLs to your vocab items, or use Word/Definition mode

### No Sound
- **Check**: Is your browser muted? Is the game muted?
- **Solution**: Click the mute/unmute button, check browser audio settings

### Cards Not Flipping
- **Check**: Is it your turn? Have you already selected two cards?
- **Solution**: Wait for your turn, wait for cards to flip back after 3 seconds

### AI Not Moving
- **Check**: Is the game frozen? Check browser console for errors
- **Solution**: Try refreshing the page and restarting the game
