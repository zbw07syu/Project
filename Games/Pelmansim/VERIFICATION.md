## Feature Verification

### ✅ Modal System (4 Modals)
- **Line 54** (index.html): `<div id="teamCountModal" class="modal">`
- **Line 65** (index.html): `<div id="humanCountModal" class="modal">`
- **Line 72** (index.html): `<div id="vocabCountModal" class="modal">`
- **Line 88** (index.html): `<div id="gameModeModal" class="modal">`

### ✅ Audio Elements
- **Line 49** (index.html): `<audio id="bgMusic" src="handbagsgladrags.mp3" loop></audio>`
- **Line 50** (index.html): `<audio id="pairFoundSfx" src="pairfound.wav"></audio>`
- **Line 51** (index.html): `<audio id="pairNotFoundSfx" src="pairnotfound.wav"></audio>`

### ✅ Victory Manager Integration
- **Line 115** (index.html): `<script src="../victoryManager.js"></script>`

### ✅ 3-Second Reveal Timer
- **Line 383** (game.js): `setTimeout(() => checkMatch(), 3000);`

### ✅ Game Launch Logic
- **Line 1251-1252** (app.js): Memory Madness launch code
```javascript
} else if (choice === 'memorymadness') {
  window.open(`./Games/Pelmansim/index.html#questions=${data}`, '_blank');
}
```

### ✅ Visibility Control
- **Line 1435** (app.js): `const memoryMadnessOption = $('#memoryMadnessGameOption');`
- **Line 1444-1446** (app.js): Hide/show logic based on list type
```javascript
if (memoryMadnessOption) {
  const shouldHide = !list || list.listType !== 'vocab';
  memoryMadnessOption.style.display = shouldHide ? 'none' : 'flex';
}
```

### ✅ Fallback Selection Logic
- **Line 1460-1467** (app.js): Auto-select RunRunRabbit if Memory Madness becomes hidden

### ✅ Vocab Payload Building
- **Line 1207-1219** (app.js): Proper vocab list payload structure
```javascript
if (list.listType === 'vocab') {
  payload = {
    id: list.id,
    name: list.name || 'Untitled',
    listType: 'vocab',
    questions: list.questions.map(q => ({
      type: 'vocab',
      word: q.word || '',
      image: q.image || '',
      definition: q.definition || ''
    }))
  };
}
```

## Integration Verification

### ✅ Main Application Integration
1. **Game Selection Modal**: Memory Madness option added with ID `memoryMadnessGameOption`
2. **Radio Button**: Value `memorymadness` for game selection
3. **Visibility Logic**: Only shows for vocab lists
4. **Launch Logic**: Opens game in new tab with payload in URL hash
5. **Fallback Logic**: Selects alternative game if Memory Madness becomes unavailable

### ✅ Payload Flow
```
Editor → app.js → Build Vocab Payload → URL Hash → game.js → Parse & Validate → Game Start
```

### ✅ Victory Flow
```
All Pairs Found → Determine Winner → victoryManager.launchVictory() → Effects + Music
```

- [ ] Test all 4 modals in sequence
- [ ] Test with 2, 3, and 4 teams
- [ ] Test with all human teams
- [ ] Test with all AI teams
- [ ] Test with mixed human/AI teams
- [ ] Test with 6, 12, 18, and 24 vocab items
- [ ] Test Word/Image mode
- [ ] Test Word/Definition mode
- [ ] Test card selection and matching
- [ ] Test 3-second reveal timer
