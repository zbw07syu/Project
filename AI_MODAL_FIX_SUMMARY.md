# AI Modal Fix Summary - RunRunRabbit

## Problem Description
After the modal for selecting an option for multiple choice questions closes, the AI wolf does not roll the dice or move sometimes, causing the game to get stuck.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by timing conflicts and race conditions between:
1. Modal closing callbacks (100ms delay)
2. Modal closed event handling (300ms + 200ms delays)
3. AI action scheduling (400ms delay)
4. Game state management during transitions

These stacked delays and inconsistent state management caused the AI to either:
- Miss its turn to act
- Get stuck in an "action in progress" state
- Have its action scheduled but never executed due to state mismatches

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Modal System Timing Improvements (`shared-modal.js`)
- **Reduced modal callback delay**: From 100ms to 50ms for faster response
- **Reduced modal closed event delay**: From 300ms to 150ms for faster state updates

### 2. AI Action Coordination Improvements (`game.js`)
- **Reduced modalClosed event processing delay**: From 200ms to 100ms
- **Reduced AI scheduling delay**: From 400ms to 200ms in `showNextOrEnd`
- **Reduced modal wait retry limit**: From 15 retries (1.5s) to 10 retries (1s)

### 3. Enhanced Modal State Detection
- **Improved `attemptAISelection`**: Added DOM-based modal detection alongside state tracking
- **Faster retry intervals**: Reduced from 100ms to 50ms for modal state checks

### 4. AI Action Flag Management
- **Reset in `handleOptionSelect`**: Clear `aiActionInProgress` when modal callback executes
- **Reset in `endMovementPhase`**: Clear flag during phase transitions
- **Safety reset in `showNextOrEnd`**: Clear flag before scheduling AI actions

### 5. Game State Stabilization
- **Added stabilization delay**: 50ms delay in `showNextOrEnd` to ensure state consistency
- **Enhanced state validation**: Better checks for `isDiceTurn` and `currentPlayer` consistency

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified:
1. `/Games/shared-modal.js` - Modal timing improvements
2. `/Games/RunRunRabbit/game.js` - AI coordination and state management

### Key Function Changes:
- `showOptionsModal()` - Reduced callback delay
- `closeModal()` - Reduced state update delay
- `modalClosed` event handler - Faster processing
- `attemptAISelection()` - Better modal detection
- `handleOptionSelect()` - AI flag reset
- `endMovementPhase()` - AI flag reset
- `showNextOrEnd()` - Timing and state improvements
- `maybeAutoRollIfAI()` - Reduced retry limits

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. Modal closes smoothly after option selection
2. AI Wolf automatically rolls dice within 1-2 seconds
3. AI Wolf moves to valid square after rolling
4. Game continues to next player without getting stuck
5. No console errors related to modal state or AI actions

## Testing
- Created test file: `test-ai-modal-fix.html`
- Test with multiple choice questions that trigger modals
- Verify AI behavior after modal closes
- Check console for timing and state logs

## Performance Impact
- **Positive**: Faster response times (reduced delays)
- **Positive**: More reliable AI behavior
- **Neutral**: No significant performance overhead
- **Positive**: Reduced chance of stuck states

## Backward Compatibility
- All changes are backward compatible
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Improved robustness for edge cases
