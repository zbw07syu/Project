# Path Update Summary for Root index.html

## Overview
Updated all resource paths in `/Users/apple/Desktop/Project/index.html` to correctly reference files in the `Editor/` subdirectory.

## Changes Made

### 1. CSS File Path
**Before:** `./styles.css`  
**After:** `./Editor/styles.css`  
**Line:** 23

### 2. Audio File Path
**Before:** `./billiejeanchiptune.mp3`  
**After:** `./Editor/billiejeanchiptune.mp3`  
**Line:** 27

### 3. JavaScript File Path
**Before:** `./app.js`  
**After:** `./Editor/app.js`  
**Line:** 196

## File Structure
```
/Users/apple/Desktop/Project/
├── index.html (root - updated paths)
├── Editor/
│   ├── styles.css
│   ├── app.js
│   ├── billiejeanchiptune.mp3
│   └── assets/
└── Games/
    ├── RunRunRabbit/
    │   └── index.html
    ├── Tornado/
    │   └── index.html
    └── Icebreak/
        └── index.html
```

## Game Links
The game links in `Editor/app.js` use relative paths (`../Games/`) which work correctly because:
- The JavaScript file is located at: `/Users/apple/Desktop/Project/Editor/app.js`
- The relative path `../Games/` resolves to: `/Users/apple/Desktop/Project/Games/`
- This is correct and **no changes were needed** to the game links

### Game Link Paths (in app.js)
- Line 655: `../Games/Icebreak/index.html`
- Line 862: `../Games/RunRunRabbit/index.html`
- Line 864: `../Games/Tornado/index.html`
- Line 866: `../Games/Icebreak/index.html`

## Testing

### To Test Locally
1. Start a local HTTP server:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/apple/Desktop/Project
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

2. Open in browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/index.html
   ```

### What to Verify
- ✅ CSS styles load correctly (Bangers font, colorful UI)
- ✅ Background music plays (billiejeanchiptune.mp3)
- ✅ Audio controls work (volume slider, mute button)
- ✅ Question editor loads and functions properly
- ✅ Create/Edit/Delete operations work
- ✅ Preview functionality works
- ✅ Game links open correctly:
  - RunRunRabbit game
  - Tornado game
  - Icebreak game
- ✅ All images and assets appear correctly

## Notes
- No files were moved or renamed
- Only path references in `index.html` were updated
- The `app.js` file paths remain unchanged as they are relative to the JavaScript file location
- All external resources (Google Fonts) remain unchanged
- LocalStorage functionality is preserved

## Browser Compatibility
The application should work in all modern browsers when served through an HTTP server. Direct file:// protocol access may have limitations due to CORS policies.
