## 📝 Example

**List Name:** "Ocean Life"

**AI Generates:**
- **Coral** - "A hard, colorful substance formed by tiny sea animals..." + 🖼️ coral reef image
- **Kelp** - "A large brown seaweed that grows in underwater forests..." + 🖼️ kelp forest image
- **Plankton** - "Tiny organisms that drift in the ocean..." + 🖼️ microscopic image

## 💡 Tips

- **Be specific with your list name** - "Rainforest Animals" works better than just "Animals"
- **Images are automatic** - The AI finds relevant images from Unsplash
- **Everything is editable** - Change any word, definition, or image after generation
- **Mix AI and manual** - Generate some items, then add your own

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Server must be running: `./start-server.sh`
- OpenAI API key configured in `server_backup/.env`

## 🎯 What You Get

Each vocab item includes:
- **Word** (required)
- **Definition** (optional but AI provides it)
- **Image** (optional but AI provides it)

Remember: You must have **either an image OR a definition** for each word!

## 🔧 Customization

After AI generation, you can:
- ✏️ Edit any word or definition
- 🖼️ Replace AI images with your own URLs
- 📁 Upload custom image files
- ➕ Add more vocab items manually
- ❌ Delete items you don't want

## 🎓 Best Practices

1. **Choose focused themes** - "Solar System Planets" > "Science"
2. **Review definitions** - Make sure they're appropriate for your students
3. **Check images** - Unsplash images are random, so verify they match
4. **Save frequently** - Don't lose your work!

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**AI button doesn't work?**
- Make sure the server is running
- Check your OpenAI API key

**Images not loading?**
- Check your internet connection
- Unsplash might be slow - give it a moment
- You can always replace with your own image URL

**Don't like the results?**
- Click "Generate with AI" again for different words
- Edit individual items manually
- Mix AI-generated and manual entries
