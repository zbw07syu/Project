## Troubleshooting

### If CSS doesn't load:

2. Verify the file exists: `/Users/apple/Desktop/Project/Editor/styles.css`
3. Check the path in index.html line 23

### If JavaScript doesn't work:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify the file exists: `/Users/apple/Desktop/Project/Editor/app.js`
3. Check the path in index.html line 196

### If audio doesn't play:
1. Make sure you've clicked the unmute button (browsers block autoplay)
2. Check browser console for audio loading errors
3. Verify the file exists: `/Users/apple/Desktop/Project/Editor/billiejeanchiptune.mp3`
4. Check the path in index.html line 27

### If games don't open:
1. Check that game files exist in `/Users/apple/Desktop/Project/Games/`
2. Verify the paths in `Editor/app.js` (lines 655, 862, 864, 866)
3. The paths should be relative: `../Games/[GameName]/index.html`

## Browser Console Check

Open the browser console (F12) and paste this command to verify all resources:

```javascript
console.log('CSS:', document.querySelector('link[href*="styles.css"]')?.href);
console.log('JS:', document.querySelector('script[src*="app.js"]')?.src);
console.log('Audio:', document.querySelector('#bgAudio')?.src);
```

All three should show valid URLs pointing to the Editor directory.

## Files Verified

All required files exist at their expected locations:
- ‚úÖ `/Users/apple/Desktop/Project/Editor/styles.css`
