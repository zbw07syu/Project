# Critical AI Wolf Fixes

## Major Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Variable Declarations (CRITICAL)

**Problem**: Two critical variables were being used without proper declarations:
- `answerShown` - Used to track if answer has been shown
- `losers` - Array of loser player names from PSS round

**Impact**: 
- `answerShown` being `undefined` would cause AI auto-selection condition `!answerShown` to fail
- `losers` being `undefined` would cause crashes when accessing loser information

**Fix Applied**:
```javascript
// Added to global variable declarations (lines 101, 488)
let answerShown = false; // Track if answer has been shown for current question
let losers = []; // Array of loser player names from PSS round
```

### 2. Enhanced AI Auto-Selection Debugging

**Problem**: Insufficient debugging made it hard to identify why AI wasn't selecting options

**Fix Applied**:
- Added comprehensive logging to AI detection logic
- Added detailed logging to AI selection attempts
- Added logging to `handleOptionSelect` function
- Added modal state checking before AI actions

### 3. Improved Modal State Coordination

**Problem**: Race conditions between modal transitions and AI actions

**Fix Applied**:
- Enhanced modal state tracking ('opening', 'open', 'closing', 'closed')
- Added retry logic for AI actions during modal transitions
- Better coordination between timeout-based and event-based AI actions

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **AI Detection**: Should now properly identify AI players using both `isHuman` property and `humanTeams` Set
2. **AI Auto-Selection**: AI should automatically select options when losing PSS rounds
3. **Race Condition**: Reduced frequency of modal race conditions through better state coordination

## Debug Messages to Look For

### AI Auto-Selection Working:
```
ü§ñ AI Auto-Selection Debug: {currentLoser: "wolf", isHumanLoser: false, ...}
ü§ñ AI will auto-select option in 200ms
ü§ñ attemptAISelection called - modalState: closed, answerShown: false
ü§ñ AI auto-selecting option: "Option Text" at index 1
ü§ñ Calling handleOptionSelect with: {selectedOption: "Option Text", randomIndex: 1}
üìù handleOptionSelect called: {selectedOption: "Option Text", index: 1, answerShown: false}
```

### AI Auto-Selection Issues:
```
ü§ñ AI auto-selection cancelled: {answerShown: true, hasCurrentQuestion: true, ...}
üìù Skipping option select - already shown or victory
```

### AI Detection Issues:
```
ü§ñ isPlayerAI check for wolf: {hasIsHumanProperty: true, isHumanByProperty: false, isHumanBySet: false, isAI: true}
```

## Testing Steps

1. Start a 2-player game with rabbit as human, wolf as AI
2. Open browser console to monitor debug messages
3. Play until AI wolf loses PSS and faces multiple choice question
4. Verify AI automatically selects an option without human intervention
5. Check console for the expected debug message sequence above

## Files Modified

- `/Users/apple/Desktop/Project/Games/RunRunRabbit/game.js`
  - Added missing variable declarations (lines 101, 488)
  - Enhanced AI auto-selection debugging (lines 2246-2311)
  - Improved modal state coordination (lines 2284-2309)
  - Added AI detection debugging (lines 123-129)

- `/Users/apple/Desktop/Project/Games/shared-modal.js`
  - Enhanced modal state tracking (lines 245-270, 305-350)
  - Better timing coordination for modal transitions

## Next Steps if Issues Persist

1. Check browser console for the specific debug messages listed above
2. Verify that `answerShown` and `losers` variables are properly initialized
3. Confirm AI detection is working by checking `isPlayerAI` debug output
4. Test with the debug page at `/Users/apple/Desktop/Project/debug_ai_selection.html`

The missing variable declarations were likely the root cause of the AI auto-selection not working. These fixes should resolve both the race condition frequency and the AI auto-selection issues.
