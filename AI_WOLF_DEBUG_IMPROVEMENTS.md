# AI Wolf Debug Improvements

## Issues Being Addressed

1. **Race Condition**: AI wolf modal race condition still occurring intermittently
2. **AI Auto-Selection**: AI wolf not automatically choosing options when answering questions

## Debug Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced AI Auto-Selection Debugging

**File**: `game.js` (lines 2246-2255)
- Added comprehensive logging for AI auto-selection logic
- Logs current loser, player object, AI detection results
- Shows humanTeams Set and all players with their isHuman status
- Helps identify if AI detection is working correctly

### 2. Modal State Coordination

**File**: `game.js` (lines 2262-2281)
- Added modal state checking before AI selection attempts
- Implements retry logic if modal is still transitioning
- Prevents AI actions during modal open/close transitions

**File**: `shared-modal.js` (lines 245-270, 305-350)
- Enhanced modal state tracking with 'opening', 'open', 'closing', 'closed' states
- Proper timing for state transitions (300ms CSS transition duration)
- Better coordination between modal events and game logic

### 3. Improved Race Condition Handling

**File**: `game.js` (lines 2463-2470)
- Enhanced modal state checking in scheduled AI rolls
- Added modalTransitioning detection
- Better coordination between timeout-based and event-based AI actions

**File**: `game.js` (lines 266-293)
- Improved modal closed event handler
- Ensures modal is fully closed before processing pending AI actions
- Added recursive retry logic for modal state verification

### 4. Enhanced AI Detection Debugging

**File**: `game.js` (lines 123-129)
- Added detailed logging to `isPlayerAI` function
- Shows all AI detection criteria and results
- Helps identify issues with humanTeams Set or isHuman properties

## Debug Tools Created

### 1. AI Selection Debug Test Page
**File**: `debug_ai_selection.html`
- Interactive test page for debugging AI detection logic
- Tests player initialization, humanTeams setup, and modal state simulation
- Helps verify AI detection works correctly in isolation

## Key Debug Information to Look For

### AI Auto-Selection Issues
Look for these console messages:
- `ðŸ¤– AI Auto-Selection Debug:` - Shows AI detection results
- `ðŸ¤– AI will auto-select option in X ms` - Confirms AI scheduling
- `ðŸ¤– AI auto-selecting option:` - Confirms AI actually selects
- `ðŸ¤– AI auto-selection cancelled` - Shows why AI didn't select

### Race Condition Issues
Look for these console messages:
- `ðŸ¤– Modal still open/transitioning during scheduled AI roll` - Modal coordination
- `ðŸ¤– Modal closed event received` - Event handler execution
- `ðŸ¤– Modal not fully closed yet, waiting...` - State verification
- `ðŸ¤– Processing pending AI player:` - Pending player processing

### AI Detection Issues
Look for these console messages:
- `ðŸ¤– isPlayerAI check for X:` - Shows AI detection logic results
- Check `hasIsHumanProperty`, `isHumanByProperty`, `isHumanBySet` values
- Verify `humanTeams` Set contains expected values

## Testing Steps

1. **Start a 2-player game** with rabbit as human, wolf as AI
2. **Open browser console** to see debug messages
3. **Play until AI wolf loses** and needs to answer a question
4. **Watch for AI auto-selection messages** in console
5. **Check if AI actually selects an option** automatically

## Expected Behavior

1. AI wolf should be detected correctly as AI player
2. When AI wolf loses and faces multiple choice question:
   - Should see "AI Auto-Selection Debug" message
   - Should see "AI will auto-select option" message
   - Should automatically select an option after delay
   - Should not require human intervention

## Common Issues to Check

1. **humanTeams Set not properly initialized** - Check if it contains expected player names
2. **isHuman property not set** - Check if `applyHumanAIAssignments()` was called
3. **Modal state conflicts** - Check if modal state tracking is working
4. **Race conditions** - Check timing between modal events and AI actions

## Next Steps if Issues Persist

1. Use the debug test page to verify AI detection logic works in isolation
2. Check browser console for the specific debug messages listed above
3. Verify game initialization sequence (setupPlayers â†’ applyHumanAIAssignments)
4. Test with different player configurations (3-player, 4-player games)
