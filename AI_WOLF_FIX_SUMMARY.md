# AI Wolf Modal Race Condition Fix - Summary

## Problem Description
The AI wolf would sometimes fail to roll dice or move after closing a multiple choice question modal during 2-player games, causing the game to become stuck and unplayable.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by multiple overlapping race conditions between:

1. **Modal callback timing**: 100ms delay before executing the answer handler
2. **Modal closed event**: 50ms delay before dispatching the event
3. **AI auto-roll scheduling**: 400ms delay from dice phase transition
4. **AI loser auto-advance**: Variable delay (300-1000ms) for auto-clicking next button
5. **Modal retry logic**: 100ms intervals checking if modal is closed

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Enhanced Modal Event Coordination
**File**: `game.js` (lines 264-281)
- Increased modal closed event handler delay from 50ms to 200ms
- Added game state validation before processing pending AI players
- Added logging to track modal event processing

### 2. Improved AI Scheduling Logic
**File**: `game.js` (lines 2398-2438)
- Increased AI auto-roll delay from 300ms to 400ms
- Added check for existing pending AI players to prevent duplicates
- Added modal state detection during scheduled AI roll
- Enhanced logging for debugging timing issues

### 3. Enhanced maybeAutoRollIfAI Function
**File**: `game.js` (lines 3044-3231)
- Added pendingAIPlayer tracking to prevent duplicate calls
- Improved player mismatch handling with pending player cleanup
- Added pending player cleanup on successful completion and errors
- Enhanced logging with pending player state information

### 4. AI Loser Coordination
**File**: `game.js` (lines 2223-2236)
- Added check for `aiActionInProgress` before auto-clicking next button
- Added delay if AI action is in progress to prevent interference
- Ensures AI loser actions don't conflict with AI wolf dice rolling

### 5. Modal Callback Timing Optimization
**File**: `shared-modal.js` (lines 312-317)
- Reduced modal callback delay back to 100ms to avoid interference
- Maintained balance between stability and responsiveness

## Key Timing Improvements

| Component | Old Timing | New Timing | Reason |
|-----------|------------|------------|---------|
| Modal closed event handler | 50ms | 200ms | Ensure modal callback completes |
| AI auto-roll scheduling | 300ms | 400ms | Allow modal callback + stabilization |
| Modal callback | 150ms | 100ms | Reduce interference with AI scheduling |
| AI loser next button | Immediate | Conditional delay | Prevent conflict with dice actions |

## Safety Mechanisms Added

1. **Duplicate Prevention**: Check for existing pending AI players
2. **State Validation**: Verify game state before AI actions
3. **Cleanup on Completion**: Clear pending players when actions complete
4. **Cleanup on Error**: Clear pending players when errors occur
5. **Timeout Safety**: Existing 10-second timeout for stuck AI actions
6. **Player Mismatch Recovery**: Enhanced logic to fix player state issues

## Testing Recommendations

1. **2-Player Games**: Test AI wolf vs human rabbit scenarios
2. **Multiple Choice Questions**: Focus on questions that trigger modals
3. **Rapid Interactions**: Test quick modal closing and game progression
4. **Edge Cases**: Test with different AI_SPEED settings
5. **State Transitions**: Verify smooth PSS to dice phase transitions

## Monitoring and Debugging

Enhanced logging has been added with ðŸ¤– emoji prefixes for AI-related actions:
- Modal event processing
- AI scheduling decisions
- Pending player management
- State validation and recovery
- Timing coordination

## Expected Outcome

These changes should eliminate the race condition by:
1. Ensuring proper timing coordination between modal and AI systems
2. Preventing duplicate AI action scheduling
3. Providing robust fallback mechanisms
4. Maintaining game state consistency
5. Adding comprehensive error recovery

The AI wolf should now reliably roll dice and move after modal closure, ensuring uninterrupted gameplay.
