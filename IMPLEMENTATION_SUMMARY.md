  - lightBurst
- [x] Effects run indefinitely until Restart is clicked
- [x] Effects are reusable across all games
- [x] 2 unique effects randomly selected per victory

### ‚úÖ 2. Victory Music System

  - moveonup.mp3
  - Celebrationchiptune.mp3
  - wearethechampions.mp3
- [x] 1 track randomly selected per victory
- [x] Music plays once per victory

### ‚úÖ 3. Mute/Unmute Functionality
- [x] Respects mute state when victory starts
- [x] Music stays muted if game is muted
- [x] Music plays at normal volume if unmuted
- [x] Toggling mute during victory affects music immediately

### ‚úÖ 4. Modular System
- [x] Created shared `victoryManager.js` module
- [x] Created shared `assets/audio/` directory
- [x] Exported `playVictorySequence()` function
- [x] Exported `stopVictorySequence()` function
- [x] Exported `updateMuteState()` function
- [x] System works across all three games

### ‚úÖ 5. Victory Sequence Features
- [x] Randomly selects 2 unique visual effects
- [x] Randomly selects 1 music track
- [x] Triggers both effects immediately
- [x] Plays music track once
- [x] Loops effects until Restart clicked
- [x] Avoids repeating same combination (70% reroll)
- [x] Graceful error handling for missing files
- [x] Fallback to original effects if Victory Manager fails

### ‚úÖ 6. Git & Deployment
- [x] All changes committed to Git
- [x] All changes pushed to GitHub
- [x] Code deployed to GitHub Pages

## üéØ Key Features Implemented

### Random Combination System
- **198 total possible combinations** (66 effect pairs √ó 3 music tracks)
- Smart avoidance: 70% chance to reroll if same combination used consecutively
- Ensures variety in victory celebrations

### Performance Optimizations
- Canvas-based particle systems for smooth animations
- Particle count scales with screen size
- Efficient rendering with `requestAnimationFrame`
- Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks

### Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks around all operations
- Graceful degradation if Victory Manager fails
- Console warnings for debugging
- Fallback to original effects

### Cross-Game Compatibility
- Single codebase works across all three games
- Each game maintains its own mute state
- Callback pattern for loose coupling
- Backward compatible with existing effects

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing:
1. Open any of the three games
2. Play until victory is achieved
3. Observe 2 random visual effects and 1 music track
4. Test mute/unmute during victory
5. Click Restart to verify effects stop cleanly
6. Play again to verify different combination

### Test Suite:
1. Open `Games/test-victory.html` in browser
2. Click "Start Victory Sequence" to test random combinations
3. Use "Toggle Mute" to test audio control
4. Use "Stop Victory Sequence" to test cleanup
5. Check test log for any errors

### Browser Compatibility:
- ‚úÖ Chrome/Edge (Chromium)
- ‚úÖ Firefox
- ‚úÖ Safari
- ‚úÖ Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## üéì Technical Highlights

### Architecture Decisions:
1. **IIFE Module Pattern** - Isolated scope with clean API
2. **Callback Pattern** - Loose coupling for mute state
3. **Canvas + CSS Hybrid** - Best tool for each effect type
4. **Dynamic DOM Creation** - No HTML bloat
5. **Graceful Degradation** - Fallback to original effects

### Performance Considerations:
1. Particle count scales with screen size
2. RequestAnimationFrame for 60fps
3. Efficient canvas clearing and redrawing
4. Proper cleanup of intervals and animation frames
5. Z-index management for layering

### Code Quality:
1. Comprehensive error handling
2. Console logging for debugging
3. Backward compatibility maintained
4. Modular and reusable code
5. Well-documented functions
